## Repository Overview

This is a business strategy document repository for **Zynkr**, an AI consulting and enablement company. The repository currently contains one file:

- `zynkr_business_strategy.md` — The master business strategy document covering vision, brand, business model, operations, consultancy methodology, action plan, org structure, and team culture.

## Document Structure

The strategy document is organized into these major sections:

- **Vision & Mission** — Empower professionals to compete in the AI era
- **Brand** — "Synchronization & thinking"; closes Knowledge, Cognitive, and Execution gaps
- **Strategy Blueprint** — Four horizons: Individual Courses → Systemization → Enterprise → Agentization/Platform
- **Business Model** — B2C (low and high tier) + B2B enterprise + Agent Marketplace
- **Operations** — Seven pillars: Brand & Marketing, Consultant & Sales, Operations, Learning, Dev Ops, Product & Tech, People & Talent
- **Consultancy Methodology** — Three phases: Discovery & Diagnosis → AI Prototyping → Change Management
- **Action Plan** — Four phases (0–3) with milestones in NT$ revenue targets
- **Organization** — Functional team structure across six departments

## Key Context

- Target markets: Taiwan (revenue targets in NT$) with global aspirations
- Core differentiator: Human-centered AI adoption, not hype or standalone tech
- Business trajectory: B2C courses → B2B consulting → AI Agent Marketplace platform
- The "flywheel": More Users → More Data → Stronger Agents → More Experts → Richer Ecosystem → More Users
